Bronâ€“Kerbosch algorithm to determine all maximal groups of people such that all the employees in a group have at least one common ability.\
The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all maximal cliques in an undirected graph, starting with an empty
set and recursively exploring all potential vertex combinations, iteratively eliminating vertices that cannot be part of cliques, until no more there
are vertices available to add.
